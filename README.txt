#Description: This program reads GPS data in the form of NMEA sentences of the ISPVAA standard. The user will
#			specify two files at the command line. The first filename will be the file that holds the GPS data
#			that the program will read-in and parse. The second filename will be the file that holds the journey
#			data for the trip, where the names of the visited locations will be in alphabetical and chronological
#			order.
